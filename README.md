# Finance-Tada

## Inspiration
The lack of financial knowledge and how to manage personal funds pushes many people into debts and reckless spending. Further, many young people do not know how to invest and increase their funds. This results in many people do not have enough funds to live when they get older. 

This points to the need for educating people about finance and investment. People need to know how to budget and divide their spending funds monthly. People should also understand about debts and how to manage them to avoid crisis. Finally, stocks and crypto currencies care tools that can help people increase their personal funds. 

Because of above points, we want to introduce Financetada, the financial hub that teaches you finance. You can learn about managing your finance, investing in stocks or crypto currencies in our site. Further, you can track crypto currencies, test your knowledge, and chat with our chat bot for education or getting inquiries about your balance/wallet. 

## What it does
Welcome to Financetada, Our mission is equipping current generations with financial and practical life experience. We teach students different financial topics about budgeting, debt, crypto currency and stock. We also have a crypto currency real time chart and crypto currency converter. 
Further, we have a financial quiz that tests users about their financial knowledge. You can also manage your expenses by using an expense tracker.

First we capture the photo of the receipt, then the photo of the receipt is read by computer and the expenses are noted down. Users can contact us by texting +1386204612. 
We ask about users' names and phone numbers, the info is noted down for our staff to contact users. We have a chat bot that provides real time BTC price and provides info about crypto.

## SAP build
We use SAP to build our chat bot which is intelligent enough to get real time crypto price and is able to answer and educate users about financial questions such as checking account or credit card. 

## Challenges we ran into
The first challenge is about brainstorming ideas. To reach a common agreement about the character, we had to discuss and reject a lot of ideas. We discussed a lot about designing and how to make the site look pretty and user friendly. The next one is about building the chat bot and figuring out the logic as well as how to set up the chat bot to get info about crypto, stock, account balance, etc.
